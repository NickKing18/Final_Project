				<p>In 2023, the University of Oklahoma’s softball team was on top of the world. The Sooners set an NCAA record with 53 consecutive wins en route to their third straight Women’s College World Series championship.</p>
				<p>Meanwhile, Oklahoma’s baseball team had a season it would rather forget. One year after a runner-up finish, the Sooners missed the College World Series with an underwhelming 32-28 record. </p>
				<p>Despite the disparity in performance, the Oklahoma baseball team received an additional $325,000 in travel funding compared to the softball team – a 30% difference.</p>
				<p>This gap is far from uncommon. In the same season, the 45 Power Five public universities with baseball and softball programs spent 32% more on baseball travel. Rachel Axon, a freelance sports journalist who has extensively covered gender disparities in college athletics, notes that these gaps are unsurprising.</p>

				<p>“When I was at USA Today,” Axon said, “we found a big difference in travel spending and modes of transportation between collegiate men’s and women’s basketball teams. That being the same for baseball and softball would have been my supposition going in.”</p>
				<p>Similar to Axon’s findings on the hardwood, discrepancies on the diamond raise concerns about potential Title IX violations. To explore further, this study analyzed travel spending data from public Power Five (now Power Four) universities with both baseball and softball programs from the 2017-2023 seasons.</p>
				<p>Additionally, data from the 2022 season is absent from this study. All figures were sourced through the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database, which compiled the statistics via open records requests.</p>
				<p>Over the six seasons analyzed, nearly $40 million more was spent on baseball travel than on softball. However, Axon noted that a per-player analysis offers better insight into the disparity than a total comparison.</p>
				<p>The NCAA limits baseball teams to 40 players and softball teams to 25. While the <a href= "https://worldwideathleticrecruitment.co/evaluating-college-baseball-roster-size/#:~:text=Roster%20sizes%20differ%20across%20divisions,various%20rules%20and%20scholarship%20funds."> average Division I baseball team carries 35 players,</a> most <a href="https://www.2adays.com/blog/average-college-softball-roster/">softball teams fill their rosters.</a></p>
				<p>Assuming all teams carry an average roster size, the travel spending gap narrows, with baseball programs receiving an average of just $17 more per player. Despite the nearly identical means, there is still potential for outliers.</p>
				<p>In her study of college basketball, Axon’s team observed that even the top women’s programs were often the most underfunded.</p>
				<p>“What we found is that even the best women’s basketball programs still spent more on men’s basketball,” Axon said.</p>
				<p>To see if this trend applied to softball, the study compared the travel spending of Women’s College World Series champions and runner-ups during the examined seasons with that of their baseball counterparts.</p>

				<p>Despite the five schools above allocating more overall travel funding to their baseball programs, softball teams at these institutions received about $1,750 more per player, suggesting the disparity is less pronounced at the ballpark than in other sports. </p>
				<p>The exception among these programs is the University of Florida. Over the six seasons examined, Gators baseball players received an average of $5,500 more in travel funding than the school's softball players. More troubling is the fact that the gap between the two programs' athletes has tripled since 2017.</p>
				<p>The U.S. Department of Education has not yet investigated Florida for these significant disparities, though the school is currently under review for nine potential Title IX violations. Axon suggests that these gaps often go unnoticed, even by team coaches, leading to a lack of complaints.</p>
				<p>“There is a culture within women’s sports coaches of accepting that difference,” Axon said. “A lot of them who we talked to when doing our basketball study didn’t know there was a huge difference. They were so focused on their program that they didn’t realize what was going on.”</p>

				<p>The University of Florida is not the only school where the disparity is concerning. Above are the five schools with the largest percentage differences in travel spending between baseball and softball programs over the six seasons analyzed. Baseball teams at these schools received an average of $5,500 more per player.</p>
				<p>Two of these schools — Virginia and North Carolina State — reduced the gap from 2017 to 2023. However, Kansas, Texas Tech, and North Carolina saw their disparities more than double.</p>
				<p>In fairness, both Texas Tech and North Carolina’s baseball teams reached the College World Series multiple times during the six seasons analyzed, while their softball teams failed to qualify most seasons, naturally widening the gap due to increased costs. However, Kansas could not hide behind that excuse.</p>
				<p>Despite neither the Kansas baseball nor softball teams reaching the championship tournament, Jayhawks baseball players received $12,000 more in travel funding in 2023, more than double the gap from the start of the study. Like Florida, Kansas has not been investigated by the Department of Education for these discrepancies.</p>
				<p>Fortunately, not all schools are perpetuating these disparities. Of the 23 schools that spent more on baseball players in 2017, 15 reduced the gap or began favoring softball over the following seven years. This trend suggests that the disparity in travel spending on the diamond for top-tier programs may be slowly closing, making athletics at the ballpark more equitable. However, a close look at institutions like Florida and Kansas reveals that there is still much work to be done in addressing these gender-based inequalities. </p>
